# unit13-challange


### Clustering Crypto Data unit 13

During this exercise I used the provided CSV and generated the code using a Jupyter notebook. Due to some people in class being charged from AWS I did not want to get caught up in that.

Overall I enjoyed this exercise and love thinking of its potential.
